# Day 1 of 90dayschallenge

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

As per my understanding, DevOps is a methodology that bridges the gap between the development and operations teams, which existed earlier. In DevOps, we use different tools and techniques to make the SDLC process more efficient than traditional approaches and to reduce the time to market of a product.
Cloud engineering helps us scale systems in an efficient manner. Earlier, we had to set up the entire infrastructure such as storage, physical servers, cooling systems, and server rooms. Now, with the help of cloud platforms, we can scale infrastructure in an efficient and cost-effective way.

Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

I started learning DevOps and Cloud to enhance my skill set and gain industry-level understanding. I have around 2 years of experience as a DevOps engineer, but I have not yet had the opportunity to work on a good industry-level project that fully requires DevOps tools and practices, as I have been allocated to a support project. I actively upskill myself and practice DevOps tools to grow as a skilled DevOps professional. This learning will also help me transition my career and switch to a new company.
(I have basic understanding of all the tool and techniques)

Where do you want to reach?

I want to switch to a company where I can work on real DevOps projects and apply my skills effectively. My goal is to continuously improve my knowledge and become a skilled DevOps professional. Ultimately, I want to build a stable career that allows me to secure a good package and support my family while fulfilling my parents’ dreams.
Goal:
Switch → Work on DevOps projects → Become a skilled professional → Support family & parents’ dreams

How will I stay consistent every single day?
I will keep reminding myself of my ultimate goal to stay motivated and focused.
On weekdays, I will dedicate 2 hours in the afternoon to learning concepts.
I will spend 1 hour at night doing hands-on practice to strengthen my understanding.
On weekends, I will attend live sessions with bhaiya.
After the live sessions, I will revisit the recorded sessions on the same day for better understanding.
Along with learning, I will continue applying to companies and maintain my hustle for switching to a better role.
